2. ‚ùå Not hazmat/restricted
3. ‚ùå Can ship to US/Canada/EU
4. ‚ùå Product cost ‚â§$15
5. ‚ùå Can achieve 3x markup minimum

**Quality Filters:**

### 6.5 Andromeda Concept Framework

**Purpose:** Ensure 10 DISTINCT concepts (not just variations)

**Replaces:** Random angle testing without structure

**Cost:** $0 (framework, not software)

**Why Critical:** Facebook algorithm change in 2024 penalizes advertisers who don't test distinct concepts. Running variations of same concept = -15-25% ROAS penalty.

**What Is a Concept?**

A concept = FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT emotional appeal, problem angle, or use case

**Example - Posture Corrector:**

**10 Distinct Concepts:**
1. **Back Pain Relief** - "Stop living with chronic back pain"
2. **Posture Confidence** - "Stand taller, feel more confident instantly"
3. **WFH Solution** - "Your desk job is ruining your spine"
4. **Anti-Aging** - "Look 10 years younger with better posture"
5. **Athletic Performance** - "Proper posture = more power in your lifts"
6. **Medical Alternative** - "Skip the $2,000 chiropractor"
7. **Energy Boost** - "Bad posture is why you're always tired"
8. **Professional Image** - "First impressions start with how you stand"
9. **Tech Neck Solution** - "Reverse years of smartphone damage"
10. **Quick Fix** - "Better posture in 21 days, guaranteed"

**NOT Distinct Concepts (These Are Variations):**
- ‚ùå "Stop back pain" vs "End back pain" vs "Relieve back pain" ‚Üí Same concept
- ‚ùå Red product vs blue product ‚Üí Same concept
- ‚ùå Male model vs female model ‚Üí Same concept
- ‚ùå Beach setting vs office setting ‚Üí Same concept

**Creative Director Workflow:**

**Day 1 Morning (2 hours):**
1. Review product (posture corrector example)
2. Brainstorm 15-20 concept ideas
3. Apply Andromeda test to each:
   - Does this concept appeal to DIFFERENT emotional driver?
   - Does this concept solve DIFFERENT problem?
   - Would these two concepts appeal to DIFFERENT audiences?
4. Select top 10 concepts that pass test
5. Write concept brief for each (1 paragraph describing angle, target audience, emotional hook)
6. Get Founder approval (30 min review)

**Day 1 Afternoon ‚Üí Week 1:**
7. Brief Video Editors on concepts
8. Create 25-30 creatives across concepts (not all concepts equal, some get more)
9. Launch campaigns structured by concept (not random)
10. Media Buyer tracks ROAS by concept (not just by ad)

**Andromeda Compliance Check:**
```
Question: "If I showed these 10 ads to someone, would they think 10 different products?"
‚Üí YES = Good concepts
‚Üí NO = Still variations, need to differentiate more
```

**Output:** Structured concept framework for all creative production

**KPI Impact:**
- ROAS: +15-25% from algorithm compliance
- Optimization: Know which concepts work (not just which ads)
- Scaling: Double down on winning concepts
- Critical: Non-compliance = -15-25% ROAS penalty

### 6.6 Kling AI - Full Video Generation (Optional)

**Purpose:** Generate product demo videos without having physical product

**Use Cases:**
- Product delayed in shipping (test angles before arrival)
- Expensive product (don't want to buy for testing)
- Testing wild angles (validate concept before investing)

**When NOT to Use:**
- Week 1 standard products (ship products, use real footage)
- After product validated (real UGC performs better)
- When budget is tight (optional tool)

**Priority:** P3 (implement Week 3+ only if specific use case)

**Monthly Cost:** $40

## SECTION 7: TEAM STRUCTURE (12 ROLES)

- Fixed salary = capped earnings
- KPI + Home Run structure = sky's the limit

**Aligns Incentives:**
- Team wins when business wins
- No "just showing up" mentality
- Quality work = more earnings

**How to Sell It:**
- Week 1 onboarding: Prove system works (team earns $50-150)
- Transparency: Live KPI dashboard
- Backlog system: Accrued earnings paid post-validation
- Home Runs: $250-5,000 bonuses for major wins

**Legal Compliance:**

- 30 re-edited videos (focus on winning concepts)
- 40 static images (double down on winners)
- 15 self-filmed UGC (product now at editor's house)
- 10 AI avatars (best concepts)
- 5 TopView demographics (identify target)

**Ad Spend:**
- $100-150/day √ó 4 days = $400-600
- Split: $250 Meta, $150 TikTok (with 2x credits = $300 effective)

**Success Criteria (ANY = SCALE):**
- 1.5+ ROAS by Day 7
- 3+ winning creatives (CTR >2.5%)
- Identified 1-2 winning concepts
- Target demographic clear from TopView

**Optimize Criteria (MAYBE):**
- 1.0-1.5 ROAS (break-even, needs work)
- 1 winning creative found (need more of same)
- Concept unclear (need more testing)

**Kill Criteria (ALL = KILL):**
- <1.0 ROAS after $600 total spend
- No winning creatives (all <2% CTR)
- Organic still dead (<5K views)

**Decision Point: Day 7 Evening**
- **SCALE** ‚Üí Proceed to Phase 3
- **OPTIMIZE** ‚Üí Extend Phase 2 by 3 days, make adjustments
- **KILL** ‚Üí Stop spend, move to next product

### 10.4 Phase 3: Full Production (Day 8+)

**Triggered By:** Phase 2 pass (1.5+ ROAS achieved)

**Creative Mix (257 full capacity):**
- 60 re-edited videos
- 120 static images (Nano Banana)
- 30 self-filmed UGC
- 30 AI avatars (Arc Ads)
- 10 TopView demographics (expanded)
- 7 organic TikToks

**Ad Spend:**
- Start: $200-300/day
- Week 2: $500-800/day
- Week 3: $1,000-2,000/day
- Week 4: $3,000-5,000/day

**Focus:**
- Double down on 2-3 winning concepts
- Eliminate losing concepts
- Expand to new audiences (lookalike, interest-based)
- Test scaling (increase budgets systematically)
- Launch UGC from Filipino creators

**Scaling Thresholds:**
- **3.0+ ROAS:** +50% budget increase daily
- **2.5-3.0 ROAS:** +30% budget increase daily
- **2.0-2.5 ROAS:** +20% budget increase daily
- **<2.0 ROAS:** Pause scaling, optimize

**Ongoing Decision:**
- Daily optimization (kill bad ads, scale winners)
- Weekly strategic review (concepts, audiences, budget allocation)
- Monthly: Evaluate if product plateaued (consider new product)

### 10.5 Multi-Product Testing Strategy

**Simultaneous Testing (Optimal):**

Rather than testing 1 product with all 257 creatives Week 1, test 5 products with Phase 1 (25-30 creatives each):

**Week 1 Approach:**
- Monday: Launch Product A (Phase 1)
- Tuesday: Launch Product B (Phase 1)
- Wednesday: Launch Product C (Phase 1), Review Product A
- Thursday: Launch Product D (Phase 1), Review Product B
- Friday: Launch Product E (Phase 1), Review Product C
- Weekend: Review Product D & E

**Results:**
- 2-3 products pass Phase 1 ‚Üí Move to Phase 2
- 2-3 products fail Phase 1 ‚Üí Kill immediately
- By Day 7: Identified 1-2 strong winners
- By Day 14: Scaling winner(s)

**Benefits:**
- Test 5 products vs 1 per week
- Find winners 5x faster
- Reduce risk (not all-in on one product)
- Sample size = 150 creatives across 5 products = still statistically significant

**Resource Allocation:**
- Creative production same (150 total Week 1)
- Split: 30 creatives per product
- Ad spend same ($625 Week 1)
- Split: $125 per product

## SECTION 11: COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

### 11.1 Compensation Philosophy

**Problem with Fixed Salaries:**
- Founder pays whether product works or not
- Team has no skin in the game
- Quality suffers (just need to show up)

**Problem with Pure Commission:**
- Week 1-4 team earns $0 (no revenue yet)
- Team quits before validation
- Morale tanks

**Solution: 7-KPI + Home Runs + Gamification**

- **Week 1-4:** KPIs only (small bounties, achievable goals, maintain morale)
- **Week 5+:** Full KPI payouts + Home Runs (uncapped upside)
- **Ongoing:** XP, badges, streaks, challenges (gamification)

### 11.2 Global Systems

**Weekly Cap: $250 per role** (Pre-validation, Week 1-4)
- Protects Founder budget
- Team can still earn consistently
- Removes Week 1-4 after validation

**Monthly Cap: $1,000 per role** (Post-validation, Week 5+)
- Applies to regular KPIs only
- Home Runs NOT capped
- Ensures sustainable comp structure

**Team Envelope: 15% of NET Revenue** (Hard Cap)
- NET = Revenue - (Ad Spend + COGS + Shipping + Fees)
- Example: $100K revenue, $40K ad spend, $20K COGS, $10K other = $30K NET ‚Üí $4,500 team comp max
- Protects profitability
- Auto-scales with revenue

**Pro-Rating Mechanism:**
If team earnings exceed 15% envelope:
- Calculate total team earnings
- Calculate 15% of NET
- If team > envelope, pro-rate all payments proportionally
- Example: Team earned $6K, envelope is $4.5K ‚Üí Everyone gets 75% of their earnings

**Backlog Clearing Pool: 10% of NET** (Post-validation)
- Accrued KPIs from Week 1-4 sit in backlog
- After validation, 10% of NET goes to clearing backlog
- Paid out over 2-4 weeks until cleared
- Ensures team gets paid for early work

**Revenue Bands & Multipliers:**
- **$0-30K/month:** 1.0x multiplier (base KPI values)
- **$30K-100K/month:** 1.1x multiplier (10% bonus on all KPIs)
- **$100K-300K/month:** 1.15x multiplier
- **$300K+/month:** 1.2x multiplier

*Example: F1 Foundation KPI normally worth $15, becomes $18 at $300K+ revenue level*

### 11.3 7-KPI Structure (Universal Framework)

**Every Role Has:**

**Foundation Tier (3 KPIs):**
- Essential deliverables

- **Bounty: $15-25 each**

**Excellence Tier (1 KPI):**
- Exceptional achievement
- Goes above and beyond
- Drives breakthrough results
- **Bounty: $100-120**
- **Total Potential: $100/week**

**Weekly Maximum (KPIs only): $250**

### 11.12 Budget Protection Analysis

**Founder's Worst Case Week 1-4:**

**Week 1:**
- 9 roles √ó $250 max = $2,250 total
- Reality: Most won't hit cap Week 1 (new, learning)
- Expected: $50-150 total team cost

**Week 2:**
- 9 roles √ó $250 = $2,250
- Reality: Some hit cap, most don't
- Expected: $500-800 total

**Week 3:**
- 9 roles √ó $250 = $2,250
- Reality: More hit cap
- Expected: $800-1,200 total

**Week 4:**
- 9 roles √ó $250 = $2,250
- Reality: Validation approaching, most hit cap
- Expected: $1,500-2,000 total

**Total Week 1-4: $3,000-4,000** (vs $0 base pay model)

**Alternative (Fixed Salary Model):**
- 9 roles √ó $500/week √ó 4 weeks = $18,000
- Paid regardless of results
- Founder at risk if product fails

**$0 Base Pay Advantage:**
- Saves $14,000-15,000 during validation
- Protects Founder if product fails
- Team still earns fairly (KPIs reward work)
- Backlog ensures team gets paid post-validation

## SECTION 13: ANDROMEDA CONCEPT FRAMEWORK

### 13.1 Why Concepts Matter (Algorithm Change 2024)

**Facebook/Meta Algorithm Update:**
- Rolled out Q2-Q3 2024
- Penalizes advertisers testing variations (not concepts)
- Rewards advertisers testing distinct concepts
- Impact: -15-25% ROAS for non-compliance

**What Changed:**
- Old: Test 50 variations of same ad, algorithm optimizes
- New: Test 10 distinct concepts, algorithm rewards diversity

**Penalty Mechanism:**
- Algorithm detects "sameness" (visual similarity, copy patterns)
- Reduces delivery + increases CPM for variations
- Prefers advertisers with distinct approaches

### 13.2 Concept vs Variation

**What Is a Concept?**
A concept = fundamentally different:
- Emotional appeal
- Problem angle
- Use case
- Target audience

**What Is a Variation?**
A variation = superficial change to same concept:
- Different color product
- Different model
- Different background
- Different hook wording (but same angle)

**Example: Posture Corrector**

**10 DISTINCT CONCEPTS:**
1. **Back Pain Relief** - "Stop living with chronic back pain"
2. **Posture Confidence** - "Stand taller, feel more confident instantly"
3. **WFH Solution** - "Your desk job is ruining your spine"
4. **Anti-Aging** - "Look 10 years younger with better posture"
5. **Athletic Performance** - "Proper posture = more power in your lifts"
6. **Medical Alternative** - "Skip the $2,000 chiropractor"
7. **Energy Boost** - "Bad posture is why you're always tired"
8. **Professional Image** - "First impressions start with how you stand"
9. **Tech Neck Solution** - "Reverse years of smartphone damage"
10. **Quick Fix** - "Better posture in 21 days, guaranteed"

**VARIATIONS (NOT Concepts):**
- ‚ùå "Stop back pain" vs "End back pain" vs "Relieve back pain" ‚Üí Same concept (back pain relief)
- ‚ùå Red posture corrector vs blue vs black ‚Üí Same concept (just color swap)
- ‚ùå Male model vs female model ‚Üí Same concept (just model swap)
- ‚ùå Office background vs gym background ‚Üí Same concept (just setting swap)

### 13.3 Andromeda Compliance Test

**Ask yourself:**

**"If I showed these 10 ads to someone unfamiliar with the product, would they think these are 10 different products solving 10 different problems?"**

‚Üí **YES** = You have distinct concepts ‚úì
‚Üí **NO** = You have variations, need to differentiate more ‚úó

**Alternative Test:**

For each pair of concepts, ask:
**"Do these two ads appeal to DIFFERENT emotional drivers or solve DIFFERENT problems?"**

- Concept 1 (Back Pain Relief) + Concept 2 (Posture Confidence) ‚Üí YES (different emotional drivers)
- Concept 1 (Back Pain Relief) + Variation ("Stop back pain" vs "End back pain") ‚Üí NO (same emotional driver)

### 13.4 Creative Director Workflow

**Day 1 Morning (3 Hours):**

**Step 1: Product Understanding (30 min)**
- Review product details
- Understand features + benefits
- Identify target markets

**Step 2: Concept Brainstorming (60 min)**
- Brainstorm 15-20 concept ideas
- Consider:
  - Different pain points product solves
  - Different demographics
  - Different use cases
  - Different emotional appeals (fear, desire, status, transformation, etc.)
- Write 1-sentence description for each

**Step 3: Andromeda Test (30 min)**
- Apply test to each pair of concepts
- Eliminate concepts that are too similar
- Ensure each concept is fundamentally distinct
- Goal: Narrow to 10 strongest concepts

**Step 4: Concept Briefs (30 min)**
- For each of 10 concepts, write brief:
  - **Concept Name**
  - **Target Audience**
  - **Emotional Hook**
  - **Pain Point Addressed**
  - **Key Benefit**
  - **Visual Style**
  - **Example Competitor Ads** (if any)

**Step 5: Founder Approval (30 min)**
- Present 10 concepts to Founder
- Get approval or feedback
- Adjust if needed

**Day 1 Afternoon (2 Hours):**

**Step 6: Team Briefing**
- Meet with Video Editor #1, #2, Copywriter
- Explain each concept's:
  - Emotional hook
  - Target audience
  - Visual style
  - Differentiation
- Show competitor examples
- Assign creative distribution:
  - Some concepts get more creatives (if higher confidence)
  - Some get fewer (testing ideas)

**Example Distribution:**
- Concept 1 (Back Pain Relief): 35 creatives (proven concept)
- Concept 2 (Posture Confidence): 30 creatives
- Concept 3 (WFH Solution): 30 creatives
- Concept 4 (Anti-Aging): 25 creatives
- Concept 5 (Athletic Performance): 25 creatives

- Concept 8 (Professional Image): 20 creatives
- Concept 9 (Tech Neck): 20 creatives
- Concept 10 (Quick Fix): 20 creatives
- **Total: 250 creatives (plus 7 organic = 257)**

### 13.5 Campaign Structure by Concept

**Media Buyer Implementation:**

**Campaign Organization:**
- Create 10 separate campaigns (one per concept)
- OR: 1 campaign with 10 concept-based ad sets
- Tag each ad with concept name

**Why This Matters:**
- Track ROAS by concept (not just by ad)
- Identify which concepts work
- Double down on winning concepts Week 2
- Eliminate losing concepts

**Example Results (Day 7):**
```
Concept 1 (Back Pain Relief): 2.8 ROAS ‚Üê Winner
Concept 2 (Posture Confidence): 2.3 ROAS ‚Üê Winner
Concept 3 (WFH Solution): 1.9 ROAS ‚Üê Marginal
Concept 4 (Anti-Aging): 0.8 ROAS ‚Üê Kill
Concept 5 (Athletic Performance): 1.2 ROAS ‚Üê Kill
Concept 6 (Medical Alternative): 2.1 ROAS ‚Üê Winner
Concept 7 (Energy Boost): 1.0 ROAS ‚Üê Kill
Concept 8 (Professional Image): 0.9 ROAS ‚Üê Kill
Concept 9 (Tech Neck): 1.5 ROAS ‚Üê Marginal
Concept 10 (Quick Fix): 1.1 ROAS ‚Üê Kill
```

**Week 2 Strategy:**
- Focus 70% of new creatives on Concepts 1, 2, 6 (winners)
- Test 30% on new angles or improvements to marginal concepts
- Kill all creatives from losing concepts
- Scale budgets for winning concepts

**Algorithm Reward:**
- Testing 10 distinct concepts ‚Üí Algorithm identifies diversity
- Delivers ads more efficiently
- Lower CPMs
- Better ROAS
- +15-25% performance vs variations
